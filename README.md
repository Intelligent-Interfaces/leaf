# leaf
A engine (`leaf.engine.ai`) for making beautiful digital booklets.

## Necessity is the Mother of Invention
In 2020, a particular epidemiological constraint encouraged the publications: [region](), [MR](), [LS2](), [AL](), [DS4_CS]() to each be digital-first publications.

But I am not too fond of the current options for digital booklet making, so I decided to make another option. Thus, leaf was birthed: to specify and build beautiful digital documents.
