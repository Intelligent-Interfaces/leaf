> An engine (`leaf.engine.ai`) for making beautiful digital booklets.

## Necessity is the Mother of Invention
During 2020 a particular epidemiological constraint encouraged the publications: [region](), [MR](), [LS2](), [AL](https://eoduniyi.github.io/anon-letters/), [DS4_CS]() to each be digital-first publications.

As the computational guide for these projects I was not too fond of the current options for digital booklet making. So, I decided to make another option. Thus, `leaf` was birthed: **to specify and build beautiful digital documents.**
